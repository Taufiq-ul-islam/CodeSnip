Given the root of a binary search tree and an integer k, return true if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to k, or false otherwise.

Constraints :

  - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].

  - -10<sup>4</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>

  - root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
      
  - -105 <= k <= 105
